Lemire's original SSB dbgen: https://github.com/lemire/StarSchemaBenchmark

If needed, a forked version is available in my repository: https://github.com/epilif1017a/StarSchemaBenchmark

Remember, this SSB+ version of the benchmark uses a more streamlined date dimension, only containing the attributes that are needed in the 13 queries.
