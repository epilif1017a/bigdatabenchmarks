# Big Data Benchmarks
Code and documents related to Big Data Benchmarks (e.g., SSB).
This repository shares shell scripts, Kafka Producers, Spark Streaming Consumers, and many other
artifacts that can be useful to evaluate Big Data systems. At the moment,
we are only concerned with an extension of the SSB benchmark, in order
to include streaming scenarios.
